# Exercise: Build Responsive Layouts with CSS Flexbox

## Introduction
We have learned advanced techniques in CSS that allows us to build responsive layouts using Media Queries, Break Points, and Flexbox. Your goal in this exercise is to strengthen your recently applied knowledge and put it to the test.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Fork this Repository
2. Clone the Repository to your computer
3. Open the Repository in VS Code
4. Start the Live Server in VS Code 
5. Follow instructions 

## Instructions
You are instructed to create 5 commonly used responsive layouts from websites which we'll provide you as simple sketches. 

We'll provide you the starter code that lays down the basic structure for the different layouts. It is your job to use Media Queries, Break Points, and CSS Flexbox to bring responsiveness into the Websites.

Remember: Always start with the mobile screen first! First build it for mobile, then expand your design and add complexity as you go.

Below you can find Break Points we want you to implement.

small: `@media (min-width: 640px)`
medium: `@media (min-width: 768px)`
large: `@media (min-width: 1024px)` 
extraLarge: `@media (min-width: 1280px)`

You don't have to use every single Break Point in every single Design, use what does make sense.
